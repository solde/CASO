fd-top - file descriptor top command
------------------------------------


fd-top is a shell script that runs in Linux - or systems with the /proc
information directory.

It lists the processes selected, with its owner, state, virtual memory
information, and open file descriptors, and the files they point to. It uses
a format similat to that of the 'top' command.


Command line options:


Us: ./fd-top.sh [info-options] [ps-process-selection-options] | -h | --help
  info selection:    --vm            show vminfo only
                     --fd            show file descriptors only
  process selection: -e              all processes
                     -u <username>   all processes running as user
                     -t <pts/N>      all processes running in tty

  "info-options" need to be provided before any "ps-process-selection-options".


Interactive keys:

Pressing the key 'q' while running stops the command.

Pressing the key 's' while running allows to change the refresh interval.

Example:

If the current terminal is pts/8,


$ cat | cat | less &     # pipeline to observe with fd-top.sh
$ fd-top.sh -t pts/8
